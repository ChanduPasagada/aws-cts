
  Lab 1 - Using Step Functions to write to S3 or DynamoDB
  --------------------------------------------------------

	1. Create three S3 buckets
	
			iquiz.stepfn.ddb.input	  	(ddb input bucket)
			iquiz.stepfn.s3.input		(s3 input bucket)	
			iquiz.stepfn.s3.output		(s3 output bucket)
			
	2. Create a DynamoDB table as follows:
	
			Table Name: step_fn_demo_table
			Partition key: row_id   
					 Type: String		

	3. Create two Lambda functions. These functions are called from within the state machine.
		
		Lambda 1: cts-stepfn-write-to-s3.py
		Lambda 2: cts-stepfn-write-to-ddb.py
		
		Role to be attached: CTSLambdaDemoRole
		Policies: AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess, AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess
	
	4. Copy the ARNs of both of the above Lambda functions and save them. 
	   We need them in the state machine JSON code. 	
   
		arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:XXXXXX:function:cts-stepfn-write-to-s3
		arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:XXXXXX:function:cts-stepfn-write-to-ddb
	
	5. Create an IAM role for 'Step Functions' with 'AWSLambdaRole'
		Note: This role is automatically added. 
	
	6. Create a State machine
		
	   6.1 Open "Step Functions" AWS Console and select 'State machines' menu option.
		   Click on 'Create state machine' button
	   6.2 Define state machine: 'Write your workflow in code' 
		   Type: 'Standard'
	   6.3 Definition:  Add the JSON code for the state-machine.
			-> Refer to "sm-s3-ddb.json" script. 
			-> Make sure you add the correct ARNs corresponding to your lambda functions. 
	   6.4 Click 'Next; button
	   6.5 State machine name: "S3AndDDBStateMachine"
		   Permissions:
				Execution Role: Choose an existing role
				Select the role you created in step 3
		6.6 Click on 'Create state machine' button.
	
	7. Create a Lambda function to invoke the above Step function

			Lambda 3: cts-stepfn-invoke-s3-ddb.py
			
			** NOTE: Make sure to use the correct ARN of your state-machine in the above script.
					 Make sure to use the correct s3 input buket name in the above script.
		
	8. Add triggers to the above lambda. 

			Triggers:   
				iquiz.stepfn.s3.input
				iquiz.stepfn.ddb.input
				
	9. Now copy users*.csv files to the above two buckets. 

			Based on what bucket you copied the file to, the state machine writes the data to 
			DynamoDB only or copies the bucket to another bucket and then writes the data to DynamoDB.
