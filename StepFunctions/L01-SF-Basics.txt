
  Lab 1 - Demo of Step Functions basic functionality
  ---------------------------------------------------

	1. 	Create two Lambda functions. 
		These functions are invoked from within the state machine.
	
			Lambda 1: cts-stepfn-1.py
			Lambda 2: cts-stepfn-2.py
			
			Role to be attached: CTSLambdaDemoRole
			Policies: AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess, AWSStepFunctionsFullAccess
			
			*** Note: We are going to use this role in the next lab.
	
	2. 	Copy the ARNs of both of the above Lambda function and save them. 
		We need them in the state machine JSON code. 	
   
			arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:XXXXX:function:cts-stepfn-1
			arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:XXXXX:function:cts-stepfn-2
	
	3. 	Create an IAM role for 'Step Functions' with 'AWSLambdaRole'
		Note: This role is automatically added. 
	
	4. Create a State machine	
	   4.1 Open "Step Functions" AWS Console and select 'State machines' menu option. 
		   Click on 'Create state machine' button
	   4.2 Define state machine: 'Write your workflow in code' 
		   Type: 'Standard'
	   4.3 Definition:  Add the JSON code for the state-machine.
			-> Refer to "sm-sf-basic.json" script. 
			-> Make sure you add the correct ARNs corresponding to your lambda functions. 
	   4.4 Click 'Next; button
	   4.5 State machine name: "SM-Basic"
		   Permissions:
				Execution Role: Choose an existing role
				Select the role you created in step 3
		4.6 Click on 'Create state machine' button.
	
	5. Execute the state machine
		
		5.1 Click on 'Start execution' button (top menu)	
		5.2 Provide the following input in the Input box (JSON code)
	
{  
    "destination" : "s3"
}

		5.3 Observe the state machine being execute. 
			You can select a node and examine the input and output.
