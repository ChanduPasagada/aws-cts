
  Lab 1: Amazon MSK Basic Operations Demo
  =========================================
  
  
  Step 1:  Setup network infrastructure for our MSK cluster
  ---------------------------------------------------------  
	1. Create a VPC with the following configurations
	
		1.1 Go to VPC Management console and click on 'Create VPC' option
		1.2 Provide the following configurations:
			Resources to create: VPC only
			Name tag: MSK-VPC  
			IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16		
			** This allows our VPC to have a host address range from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.254
		1.3	Click on 'Create VPC'.
		
	2. Create two public subnets in two different AZs
	
		2.1 Select 'Subnets' meu option and click on 'Create subnet' button
		2.2 Enter the following details:
			VPC ID: vpc-xxxxx (MSK-VPC)
			Subnet name: MSK-Public-Subnet-1A
			Availability Zone: us-east-1a
			IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/24
		2.3 Click on 'Create subnet' button to create the subnet.
		2.4 Similarly, create another subnet with the following details:
			VPC ID: vpc-xxxxx (MSK-VPC)
			Subnet name: MSK-Public-Subnet-1B
			Availability Zone: us-east-1b
			IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24
			
	3. Check the Route-table configurations (nothing to do here, just understand)
		3.1 Click on 'Route tables' menu option
		3.2 Click on the route table that is associated with your VPC
		3.3 Click on subnet associations tab. 
			Here you find both your subnets have not been explicitly associated with any route 
			tables and are therefore associated with the main route table.
			
	4. Create an Internet gateway (IGW) and connect it to our VPC.
		4.1 Click on 'Internet gateways' menu option. 
		4.2 Click on 'Create internet gateway' button
		4.3 Create with the following:
			Name tag: MSK-IGW
		4.4 Select the IGW and click on 'Actions' and select 'Attach to VPC'
		4.5 Select the VPC you created earlier and attach.
		
	5. Add a route in the route table to associate all internet traffic to the IGW.
		5.1 Click on the 'Route table' you created earlier (from route tables list)
		5.2 Click on 'Edit routes' button
		5.3 Add the following:
				Destinations: 0.0.0.0/0
				Target: Internet gateway -> select your IGW
		5.4 Click on 'Save changes' button
		
  Step 2:  Create and configure MSK cluster
  ------------------------------------------  
	6. Create MSK cluster
		6.1	Open Amazon MSK console and click on 'Create cluster' button
		6.2	Create with the following details:
		
			Creation method
				Cluster creation method : Custom create
			Cluster name
				Cluster name: MSK-Cluster
			Cluster type
				Cluster type: provisioned
			Apache Kafka version
				Apache Kafka version: 2.8.1 (latest as on the date of this writing)
			Brokers
				Broker type: kafka.t3.small
				Number of zones: 2
			Storage
				Amazon EBS Storage per broker: 1 GiB
				
			=> Next
			
			Networking
				VPC : vpc-xxxx (MSK-VPC)
				First zone: us-east-1a
				Subnet: select your subnet created in that zone
				First zone: us-east-1b
				Subnet: select your subnet created in that zone
				
			=> Next
			
			Security settings
				Unauthenticated access: check  
				IAM role-based authentication: uncheck
				
			Encryption
				TLS encryption: uncheck
				Plaintext: check
				
			=> Next
			=> Next
			
		6.3 review and click on 'Create cluster' button
		
		**** Creating an MSK cluster may take 20 to 25 minutes ****
		

  Step 3:  Create an EC2 instance to launch the Kafka clients (producers & consumers)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
	7. Open EC2 management console and lauch an instance with the following values:
			
			Name: MSK-Client-EC2
			Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) ...
			Key-Pair: Create a new key pair and save the .ppk file to connect using PuTTY
					  (Name: MSK-KeyPair-1)
			Network Settings -> Click on 'Edit' button	
				VPC: vpc-xxxx (MSK-VPC)
				Security group: leave default
				Auto-assign public IP: Enable
				Security group name: leave default  (make a note of it)
				
			Click on 'Launch instance' button
			
	Step 4: Setup two-way communication between our MSK cluster and client EC2 instance
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	8. Make a note of the security groups of your MSK cluster and also that of your EC2 instance
		8.1 Wait unitl the MSK cluster is active.
		8.2 Once active, open the cluster details page and make a note of the following details:
			Security group (of MSK cluster): sg-067bd716fe245def9  (available in Properties -> Network settings section)
		8.3. Open you EC2 instance details page and make a note of its security group as well
			Security group (of EC2 instance): sg-07e44440a09772312
	   
	9. Add a security rule to allow traffic from MSK cluster to the EC2 instance.
		9.1	Go to list of instances and click on your EC2 instance-id open open the details page
		9.2 Click on the 'Security' tab
		9.3 Click on the security group link and click on 'Edit inbound rules' button
		9.4 Add a new rule as follows:
				Type: All traffic;  Source: <MSK cluster's security group> (such as sg-067bd716fe245def9)
		9.5 Click on 'Save rules' button
		
	10. Add a security rule to allow traffic from EC2 instance to the MSK cluster .
		10.1 Open the surity group of your MSK cluster from cluster details page
		10.2 9.4 Add a new rule as follows:
				Type: All traffic;  Source: <EC2 instance's security group> (such as sg-07e44440a09772312)
		9.5 Click on 'Save rules' button
		
	
	Step 5: Setup your EC2 client instance and start communicating with Kafka
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	11. Open an SSH terminal to your EC2 instance using PuTTY
		Run the following command to install the necessary components
		
		11.1 install Java 1.8		
			sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
			
		11.2  Download and extract Kafka (make sure you are using correct version)
		
			wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.8.1/kafka_2.12-2.8.1.tgz
			tar -xvf kafka_2.12-2.8.1.tgz
			cd kafka_2.12-2.8.1
			
		11.3 Make a note of the bootstrap servers
			
			Open MSK cluster details page and click on 'View client information' button
			Here you can find the 'Private end point' for palin text.
			Make a note of these two URLs
			
		11.4 Go back to SSH terminal and create a topic. 
			 Run the following command
			 
				bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic DemoTopic1 --bootstrap-server {BOOTSTRAP-SERVER-URLs}  --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
				
		11.4 Launch a Kafka console producer and send messages.
			 Run the following command
			 
				bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic DemoTopic1 --bootstrap-server {BOOTSTRAP-SERVER-URLs}  --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1
				
		11.5 Lauch a duplicate SSH terminal and run the following commands:
		
				cd kafka_2.12-2.8.1
				bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic DemoTopic1 --bootstrap-server {BOOTSTRAP-SERVER-URLs} 
				
		=> As you produce messages from one terminal, thse messages are consumed by the consumer
