  
  Lab 4: Connecting to a Linux EC2 instance using SSH
  ---------------------------------------------------

	1. Select the EC2 instance and select 'Connect' button. Click on the 'SSH Client' tab
		* Here you find the command to connect to EC2 using SSH. 
		* Copy this command. 
		* Example: ssh -i "ctsdemo-nvirginia-keypair.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-80-227-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com

	2. Now open a Windows/Linux terminal and cd to the directory where the .pem file (the private key) is saved.
		* This is the file you downloaded when you created a Key-pair while launching an EC2 instance.
		* Make sure the .pem file has 600 permissions (i.e rw-------)

	3. Run the command you copied earlier to connect to the instance
		ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-80-227-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com
			
		* This will launch an SSH terminal connecting to the instance. 

	4. Play around in this instance.
	
		hostname -f
		uname -a
			
		** Now install Apache2 webserver
		
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install -y apache2
		sudo systemctl status apache2
		# Hit Ctrl+C to come out of the command output
 
		# Confirm that the apache server is running on port 80 using telnet
		telnet localhost 80
		telnet ec2-34-232-68-20.compute-1.amazonaws.com 80

       5. Once you are done, terminate the EC2 instance.
