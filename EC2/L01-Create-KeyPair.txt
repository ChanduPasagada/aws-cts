 
  Lab 1: Create EC2 Key Pair
  ---------------------------


   	1. Login into AWS Web Console.
	
	2. Search for EC2 and go to EC2 Console using your IAM user credentials.

	3. On the left sidebar, you have EC2 Key Pair under Security and Networking. 
	    3.1 Click on 'EC2 Key Pair' menu option
	    3.2 Provide a suitable name (ex: ctsdemo-nvirginia-keypair)
	    3.3 Click on “Create Key Pair”.

	4. Make sure to download the .pem file and save it to the standard location. 
	   You need this later to connect to the EC2 instance.

        5. Copy the .pem file to <HOME>/.ssh directory  
	   This the directory we conventionally store the SSH key files
			
	5. Change the permissions on the .pem file and .ssh folder as follows:
		 * The permissions on the .pem file should be 600 (rw-------)
                   chmod 600 ctsdemo-nvirginia-keypair.pem
		 * The permissions on the .ssh folder itself should be drwx------ (i.e 700)	


	Some important notes:
	---------------------
	* We use a .pem file for Linux/Mac and .ppk file for windows via puTTY) for the private key.
	* The .pem file is usually/conventionally stored in .ssh folder in user path (ex: /home/kanak/.ssh/mykey.pem)
	* The permissions on the .pem file should be 600 (rw-------)
	* The permissions on the .ssh folder itself should be drwx------ (i.e 700)
