  Lab 2: Create and ingest data into a Kinesis data stream using Kinesis Agent
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   *** NOTE: This lab is a continuation of previous lab i.e Lab 1 ****


   What is Kinesis agent?
   ----------------------
   Kinesis Agent is a stand-alone Java software application that offers an easy way to collect 
   and send data to Kinesis Data Streams. The agent continuously monitors a set of files and sends 
   new data to your stream.



   PREREQUISITE: Do this before step 1
   ------------------------------------	
   => Setup Cloud9 environment i.e complete Steps 1, 2 and 3 from the Lab-1



    1. Open the Cloud9 console and install kinesis agent. 
	Run the following command:

		sudo yum install â€“y aws-kinesis-agent


    2. Setup a shell script to emit streaming data to a log file. 

	2.1 Create a file 'generatelogs.sh' in the home directory and give execute permissions to it

		sudo vi generatelogs.sh

	2.2 Paste the following code in the file and save it: (:wq to save)

		while(true) do
		   sleep 1;
		   echo `date +"%H:%M:%S"` "log text" >> /tmp/app.log
		done;

	2.3 Give it executable permissions

		sudo chmod +x generatelogs.sh
	

    3. Configure the Kinesis agent

	3.1 Run the following command to open agent.json file

		sudo vi /etc/aws-kinesis/agent.json

	3.2 In this file, change the "filePattern" to "/tmp/app.log" and "kinesisStream" to your stream name (ex: "input-stream")
	     Make sure your code looks as follows. Remove the flow that mentions delivery stream.

		{
		  "cloudwatch.emitMetrics": true,
		  "kinesis.endpoint": "",
		  "firehose.endpoint": "",
		  
		  "flows": [
		    {
		      "filePattern": "/tmp/app.log*",
		      "kinesisStream": "input-stream",
		      "partitionKeyOption": "RANDOM"
		    }
		  ]
		}

	3.3 Save the file and quit (:wq to save in vi)

    
    4. Add the required policies to the IAM roles attcahed to your Cloud9 instance

	4.1 Open the IAM role 'AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole'
	4.2 Make sure you have the following two policies. (Add Kinesis and CloudWatch access policies)
		
		CloudWatchFullAccess	
		AmazonKinesisFullAccess	
		AWSCloud9SSMInstanceProfile


    5. Open a new Cloud9 terminal window and start the shell script that generate the logs

		./generatelogs.sh


    6. Start the Kinesis agent and monitor the agent logs and stream metrics
	
	6.1 Run the following command to start the agent.

		sudo service aws-kinesis-agent start

		Other commands:
		sudo service aws-kinesis-agent status
		sudo service aws-kinesis-agent stop

	6.2. Open a new Cloud9 terminal add monitor the agent logs.

		cd var/log/aws-kinesis-agent
		tail -f aws-kinesis-agent.log

	6.3 Wait for 5 to 10 minutes and check the stream metrics


    7. Stop the agent and the shell script

	7.1 Run the following command to stop the agent.

		sudo service aws-kinesis-agent stop

	7.2 Check for the status of the agent. It should be in 'inactive' state

		sudo service aws-kinesis-agent status

	7.3 Stop generating the logs by killing the shell script. 
             Ctrl+C on the terminal where generatelogs.sh script is running.


    Clean up your resources
    -----------------------

    ** Unless you want to continue with the next lab, it is better to clean up your resource to avoid charges. 

	=> Open the Cloud9 console and delete the environment.
	=> Open the Kinesis console and delete the stream.
	=> Delete the following roles:
		AWSCloud9SSMAccessRole
		AWSServiceRoleForAWSCloud9
