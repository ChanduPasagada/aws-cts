  Lab 3: Write data to a data stream using Kinesis Data Analytics Studio Notebook
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
   1. Create an S3 bucket and upload the data file
	
	Bucket Name: cts-taxitrips 
	File to be uploaded: taxi-trips.csv     (provided to you)


   2. Create a Glue database
	
	Database name: taxi-trips-db


   3. Open the 'AWS Kinesis' console and create a 'Kinesis Data Streams'

	Region: us-east-1  i.e US East (N.Virginia)  
	Data stream name: input-stream
	Capacity mode: On-demand

	Click on 'Create data stream' button


   4. From the left menu on Kinesis console click the following link.

	Analytics applications -> Studio notebooks

   
   5. Create Studio notebook and run it

	5.1 Click on the 'Analytics applications' -> 'Create Studio notebook' menu option provide the details

		Creation method: Quick create with sample code
		Studio notebook name: Taxi-Trips-Studio-Notebook-1
		AWS Glue database: taxi-trips-db

	5.2 Click on 'Create Studio notebook' button

	5.3 Make a note of the IAM role
		in my case it is : kinesis-analytics-Taxi-Trips-Studio-Notebook-1-us-east-1

	5.4 Wait until the note book is created, select it and click on 'Run' button

	5.5 Wait until the notebook comes to 'Running' status


   6. Go to IAM console and add required policies to the IAM role

	Role Name: kinesis-analytics-Taxi-Trips-Studio-Notebook-1-us-east-1
	Policies to be added: 
		AmazonS3FullAccess
		AmazonKinesisFullAccess	
		AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess	
		AmazonKinesisAnalyticsFullAccess

   7. Open the 'Apache Zeppelin' and import a notebook

	7.1 After the Studio notebook comes to 'running' status, click on 'Open in Apache Zeppelin'
	7.2 Click on ' Import note' in the Zeppelin window
	7.3 Click on the 'Select JSON file/IPYNB file'
	7.2 Browse and select the following Zeppelin file
		file name: taxi-trips-s3-to-kinesis.zpln     (provided to you)
	7.3 Click on the 'Taxi Trips Data Loading from S3 to Kinesis-1' link (this is the name of the notebook)
	    to open the zepplin notebook. 

   8. Run cells one-by-one to complete the lab. 

	** NOTE: Make sure your replace the bucket name with the URI of the file you created in step 1

	We do the following in this lab:	
		
           * Create a Glue catalog table to query data from S3 bucket.
	   * Create an in-memory table to stream data from S4 to a Kinesis data stream.
	   * Execute queries on the in-memory table to analyze streaming data.
	   
        ** NOTE: Make sure you stop the query after seeing results. 
	

    Clean up your resources
    -----------------------
	=> Close the Zeppelin notebook
    	=> Stop and delete the Studio notebook
	=> Open the Kinesis console and delete the stream.
	=> Delete the S3 bucket (cts-taxitrips)
	=> Delete the IAM role: kinesis-analytics-Taxi-Trips-Studio-Notebook-1-us-east-1
