
   Lab 2: Connecting to redshift cluster from SQLWorkbench/J
   ----------------------------------------------------------
 		   
    	1. Launch a Redshift custer (refer to Lab 1 for details)
		 => Make a note of the following: Username, Password & JDBC URL			
	
	2. Enable public access on the Reshift cluster
	
		2.1 Select the cluster and choose "Modify publicly accessible setting" from "Actions" options menu. 
			
		2.2 Select 'enable' and click on 'Save changes' button
		
		2.3 Wait until the cluster comes back to 'Available' state.		
		    NOTE: It may take long time to apply this change. (It took me more than 30 min.)		

	3. Download Redshift JDBC Driver (to a suitable folder on your local machine)

		URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/jdbc20-download-driver.html
		Driver Jar File: D:\AWSSoftware\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.1\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.1.jar 
		
		You can also download JDBC Driver from Cluster home page on Redshift AWS console.
		
	4. Download and install SQLWorkBench/J
	
		URL: https://www.sql-workbench.eu/downloads.html
		   -> Generic package for all systems including all optional libraries (sha1)

		Unzip the downloaded folder and click on the application exe file
		   -> D:\Workbench-Build127-with-optional-libs\SQLWorkbench64 
 
    	5. Open SQLWorkbench and setup to connect to redshift.
	
		5.1 Add the JDBC Driver to the SQLWorkbench/J
			-> Click on "Manage Drivers" button (towards bottom-left)
			-> Click on "Create a new entry" button (towards top-left)
			-> Give a name to your driver (ex: Amazon Redshift JDBC Driver)
			-> Browse and select the JDBC driver you have downloaded earlier. 
			  (in my case this is D:\AWSSoftware\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.1\redshift-jdbc42-2.1.0.1.jar
			-> Class Name: com.amazon.redshift.jdbc42.Driver
			-> Click OK.
			
		5.2 Create a new connection profile.
			-> Click on 'New connection profile' button (towards top-left)
			-> Fill the details:
				Give a suitable name to your profile (ex: Redshift-<ClusterName>)
				Driver: Choose the driver you created earlier
				URL: put your jdbc url link (you get this from redshift cluster details page)
				Username: Username that you used to create the cluster
				Password: Password that you used to create the cluster
				Autocommit: check this
			-> Test the connection	
				-> Click on "Test" button to test the connect.
			-> Click OK to launch the query window

		5.3 Execute queries from the query window.
		
		
	Troubleshooting:
	
		=> Check the following if the connection is not sucessful. 		  
		   -> Make sure your cluster is publicly accessible. (step 2 above)
		   -> Make sure your cluster security group allows incoming traffic from your IP.
