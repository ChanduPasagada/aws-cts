
  Lab 2 - Explore data preparation in QuickSight 
  ----------------------------------------------

	1. Create an S3 bucket and upload the following files to it.
	
			Bucket name: cts-quicksight
			Files to be uploaded: population.csv
	
	2. Create a manifest file for the above data file and upload it to the bucket	
	
		2.1 Open population-manifest.json file
		2.2 Change the URI to the bucket S3 URI. 
		2.3 Upload the manifest file to the same bucket
		
	3. Add  permission to QuickSight to access the S3 bucket you created earlier
	
		3.1 Click on your account icon (top-right head icon) and select 'Manage QuickSight'
		3.2 Select 'Security and permissions' button from left-menu.
		3.3 Click on 'Manage' button
		3.4 Click on 'Select S3 buckets' link and check your bucket (i.e cts-quicksight)
		3.5 Click 'Save' button to save changes. 
		
	4. Import data file from S3 manifest to QuickSight for data preparation
	
		4.1 Open QuickSight console
		4.2 Click on 'Datasets' menu option and click on 'New dataset' button
		4.3 Click on 'S3' option and fill the details
			Data source name: population-data
			Upload a manifest file: URL
			Enter the URL: s3://cts-quicksight/population-manifest.json
			NOTE: Yoou can alao upload the manifest file by selecting Upload option.
		4.4 Click on 'Connect' button
		4.5 Click on 'Edit/preview data'
	
	5. Look around the interface and Save your data into SPICE engine.
	
		5.1 Click on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button to save.
		5.2 Click on the QuickSight home button (top-left icon)
		5.3 Click on 'Datasets' option and select your dataset.
		5.4 Make sure your data is 100% imported.
		5.5 Click on 'EDIT DATASET' button (towards top-right)
		
	6. Let's do some data preparation	
	
		6.1 We can rename the columns by clicking on the column name in the dataset tab.
			Rename columns as follows:
				Year to year
				Region-Code to region-code
				NAME to region
				
		6.2 Save the changes by clicking on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button (towards top)
				
		6.3 We can also change the data-types of the columns
			Click on the data types for the columns below the column names row, to change the data types
		
		6.4 We can exclude/include the fields by choosing in the options from the field menu (verticle dots) 
		
		6.5 Add a new calculation field called pop-total (for total population)
			6.5.1 Click on 'Add calculation field' button
			6.5.2 Add the following expression in the formula textarea:
				{pop-fem} + {pop-male}	
		6.6 Save the changes by clicking on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button (towards top)
			
	7. Let's work with functions and operators
	
		Checkout the function reference documentation here:
		https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/functions-by-category.html
		
		7.1 Create a new calculated field called 'region-code-new' with the following expression 
		        expression: concat({country}, " ", replace(toUpper({region-code}), "!", ")"))
		7.2 Click on Save button to save changes.
		7.3 Exclude 'region-code' field  (step 6.4)
		7.4 Create a new calculated field called 'age-range-max' with the following expression 
		        expression: right({age-range}, 2)
		7.4 Save the changes by clicking on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button 
			
	8. Let's add few more calculated fields

		8.1 Create a new calculated field called 'age-group' with the following expression 
					ifelse(
						{age-range-max} = "04" OR {age-range-max} = "09", "Child",
						{age-range-max} = "14" OR {age-range-max} = "19", "Teenager",
						{age-range-max} = "24" OR {age-range-max} = "29", "Young Adult",
						{age-range-max} = "49" OR {age-range-max} = "64", "Adult",
						"Senior"
					)
					
		8.2 Create a new calculated field called 'pop-fem-share' with the following expression 
					ifelse({pop-total} = 0, 0, round({pop-fem}/{pop-total}, 3))
					
		8.3 Create a new calculated field called 'pop-male-share' with the following expression 
					ifelse({pop-total} = 0, 0, round({pop-male}/{pop-total}, 3))
					
		8.4 Save the changes by clicking on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button 

					
	9. Let's add some filters to our data.
	
		9.1 From the 'Filters' link (towards left-bottom), Click on 'Add filter' and select 'year'
				Filter condition: greater than or equal to
				Minimum Value: 1990
			Click on 'Apply' to add the filter.
			
		9.1 From the 'Filters' link, Click on 'Add filter' and select 'country'
				Filter type: Custom filter list
				Filter condition: Include
				List: Algeria
					  Angola       
			Click on 'Apply' to add the filter.
			
		9.2 As we need more data, let disable the filter we created in prior step
			Click country filter menu (verticle dots) and select 'Disable' option.
			
		9.3 Save the changes by clicking on 'SAVE & PUBLISH' button
