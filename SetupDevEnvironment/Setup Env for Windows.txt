  Setting up local development environment for windows 10
===========================================================


 Setup WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux)
 --------------------------------------
 
    1. Open Poweshell as Administrator  (right click on the icon and select the option)
	
    2. Display the list of valid distributions that can be installed
	
			wsl -l -o
		
	3. Install Ubuntu-20.04
	
			wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04
		
    4. Rebot windows system to continue..
		-> After rebooting the system should continue the installation
		-> Provide the required details such as username and password.		
		
	5. Check the installed version
	
			uname -a
		
	6. Exit the powershell
	
			exit
		
	7. Reconnect to the ubuntu VM
	
		-> Open the powershell again:
		
		7.1 list the existing instances
			
					wsl -l -v
				
		7.2 Connect to the existing linux installation just type 'wsl'
		
					wsl
					
					NOTE: to connect to a specific distribution (in case you jave multiple distributions installed) use:
							wsl -d <dustribution-name>

   Setup Pyhton environment on top of WSL
   --------------------------------------

	1. Open powershell as Administrator
	
	2. Launch the Ubuntu VM
	
			wsl   (or wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04)
			
	3. Change to home directory
	
			cd
			
	4. Install 'venv' and 'pip' modules
	
		4.1 Check if venv is already installed by trying to create a virtual environment called 'demo-venv'
		
			python3 -m venv demo-venv
			
			=> This should fail as we have not yet installed venv.
			
		4.2 Install venv and pip
			
				sudo apt update
				sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
				sudo apt-get install python3-pip
				
		4.3 Validate the virtual environment
			
				python3 -m venv demo-venv
				ls -ltr
				rm -rf demo-venv    (to remove the folder created above for testing)
				
		4.4 Validate pip
		
				pip3 install configparser
				

   Install AWS CLI using pip
   --------------------------
   
	1. Open powershell as Administrator
	
	2. Launch the Ubuntu VM
	
			wsl -d Ubuntu-20.04
			
	3. Change to home directory
	
			cd
			
	4. Install 'awscli' (AWS CLI tool)
	
			pip3 install awscli
			
	5. exit and re-enter the ubuntu VM

	6. Check AWS CLI installation
		
			aws
			
			
	Setup Python virtual environment for application development
	------------------------------------------------------------
	Note: Make sure you installed 'python3-venv' module.
	
	1. Setup a working directory for all your aws projects:
	
		mkdir awsprojects
		cd awsprojects
		
	2. Create a python virtual environment in your project working directory.
	
		python3 -m venv demo-venv
		
		=> This creates a directory called "demo-venv" which contains all the required 
		   libraries for self-contained python development environment.
		   
	3. Activate your venv created above
	
		source demo-venv/bin/activate
		
	4. Install the necessary AWS module called 'boto3' inside the virtual environment 
	   (make sure you run this after step 3)
	   
	   pip3 install boto3
	   
	5. Setup Jupyter Lab and validate boto3
	
		pip3 install jupyterlab
