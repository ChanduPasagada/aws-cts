    Connecting to an EC2 instance from your local machine using SSH
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Open your EC2 instance details and make a note of 'Public IPv4 DNS'

	In my case it is: ec2-44-204-91-166.compute-1.amazonaws.com


  2. Make sure SSH port (port 22) is opened in the EC2 instance to connect from your local machine

	2.1 Open a terminal on your local linux machine and run the following commands:

		telnet ec2-44-204-91-166.compute-1.amazonaws.com 22
		(This won't work if port 22 is not open in the EC2 security group)

	2.2 Open port 22 for incoming traffic on the EC2 instance (Type:SSH, Protocol:TCP Port:22)
            and allow Anywhere IPv4 (or only your IP if you want to be secure)

	2.3 Make sure you can connect to SSH from your local terminal again

		telnet ec2-44-204-91-166.compute-1.amazonaws.com 22
		(should work now)


  3. Generate SSH keys (public & private) in your local terminal

	3.1 Open your local terminal and run the following commands:

		cd ~
		ssh-keygen
		        Enter the file name to save the keys such as below: 
            		./.ssh/cloud9user

			Two key files are created in <home>/.ssh folder.
			If the file-name you entered is "cloud9user" the file names will be:
				cloud9user 	(this is private key)
				cloud9user.pub  (this is private key)

	3.2 Open the public key file and copy the contents to the clipboard.

		cat ~/.ssh/cloud9user.pub
		-> Copy the contents. Make sure you do not copy ant extra charectors like newline or space.

	3.3 Open a terminal inside your EC2 instance (you can use Cloud9 instance or Connect using 
           'EC2 Instance Connect' option to open an EC2 terminal. Make sure you connect as 'ec2-user')

	3.4 Do the following:

		cd /home/ec2-user
		vi .ssh/authorized_keys   (this file holds all authorised public keys that are allowed to connect)

		Add the copied private-key content (3.2 step above) at the end of this file.
                Save and exit.

        3.5 Now, open your local terminal and connect using the following command:

		ssh -i ./.ssh/cloud9user ec2-user@ec2-44-204-91-166.compute-1.amazonaws.com

		Format:
		ssh -i <private-key-file-path> <user-name>@<Public IPv4 DNS of the EC2 instance>

        3.6 This should connect to the EC2 instance from your local machine.
